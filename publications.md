## Electromagentic Induction
**Exploring the transient phenomena of Electromagnetic Induction** Amit Dhakulkar and Nagarjuna G. 

The main objective is to demonstrate that coil-magnet system with a
data-logger becomes an exemplary experimental model system to teach
science as well as the method of science. We first describe a task
which involves designing, constructing and conducting quantitative
experiments by students with a focus on collecting, representing and
analyzing large, real- world data sets. Second to establish the
coil-magnet as an exemplary model system which allows for easy
parameter manipulation, and third to make a case for the use of
computers for data collection and constructing graphs to bring out
salient features of scientific investigation.
