## Eliciting Students' Knowledge

Meena Kharatmal, G. Nagarjuna, “An Alternative Proposal for Eliciting
and Assessing Students’Knowledge Structure,” Episteme 2: Second
International Conference on Review of Science, Technology and
Mathematiics education, 2007. [Download PDF file](assets/An-Alternative-Proposal-for-Eliciting-and-Assessing-Students-Knowledge-Structure-2007.pdf)

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">
In this paper, we propose an objective assessment technique for
evaluating students' knowledge structure. The assessment task is to
create propositions based on with constraints i.e.  concepts and
linking words (relation types). The propositions are validated based
on a comparison with an expert's knowledge base. An illustration of
the technique is presented from the domain of senior secondary school
level biology.</p>

Analysis of Growth of Knowledge based on Concepts and Predicates,”

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">
Using the methodology of Refined Concept Mapping, we re-
represent the domain of cell biology of secondary and higher
secondary levels of textbooks. In this study, we demonstrate
that although the number of concept terms increase
progressively, the predicate terms achieve constancy
depicting a finite set. This indicates that for acquiring
expertise in a domain, a finite set of predicate terms is
sufficient. In this paper, we illustrate the methodology and
discuss the pedagogical implications of the study.</p>

## Primer for Conceptual Structures

G.Nagarjuna and M. Kharatmal, “Proposal for developing a primer for
constructing and analyzing conceptual structures,” in *Proceedings
of the 19th international conference on Conceptual structures for
discovering knowledge*, 2011, pp. 402–405. [Download PDF file](assets/A-Proposal-for-Developing-a-Primer-for-Constructing-and-Analyzing-Conceptual-Structures-2011.pdf)

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">
A rationale and proposal for developing a primer for teaching-learning
of conceptual structures is presented. The skills re- quired and
developed by an engagement of constructing and analyzing conceptual
structures are richer and easier to be dealt with in school
education. The teaching-learning context of CS is fundamental and im-
portant enough to introduce the topics from logic, philosophy,
computer science and linguistics. A proposal is made for the formation
of a special interest group for the primer.</p>

**Keywords**: primer, conceptual structures, education, knowledge repre-
sentation, propositions, logic, philosophy, teaching-learning.

## Mapping to Concept Lattices
Meena Kharatmal, "A Proposal to Extend Concept Mapping to Concept Lattices for Representing Biology"
in Summer School on “Methodology of task design – How to construct exercises for learning”  Technische Universität Dresden, Dresden, Germany , 22 – 27 September 2014. [Download PDF file](assets/A-Proposal-to-Extend-Concept-Mapping-to-Concept-Lattices-for-Representing-Biology-2014.pdf)

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">
Textbook biology knowledge is being represented as triples using
concept maps. These triples can be extended to create concept lattices
by representing objects and attributes in relation. By focusing on the
nature of semantic relations, concept neighbourhood lattices can be
generated for dependencies, associations. By representing the changes
in the attributes of objects in time, concept lattices of dynamic
propositions can be generated. As the knowledge base for the study is
textbook biology, this research on using concept lattices in school,
college biology education can be further developed with focusing on
teaching learning, cognitive assessment.</p>

**Keywords**. Concept mapping, concept lattices, formal concept
analysis, assessment, knowledge structure, biology

## Refining Concept Mapping

Meena Kharatmal and G. Nagarjuna, A Prposal to Refine Concept Mapping
for Effective Science Learning, in *Concept Maps: Theory, Methodology,
Technology Proc. of the Second Int. Conference on Concept Mapping*
Edited by A. J. Cañas, J. D. Novak, Eds.  San José, Costa Rica, 2006. [Download PDF
file](assets/A-Proposal-to-Refine-Concept-Mapping-for-Effective-Science-Learning-2006.pdf)

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">
Concept maps are found to be useful in eliciting knowledge, meaningful
learning, evaluation of understanding and in studying the nature of
changes taking place during cognitive development, particularly in the
classroom. Several experts have claimed the effectiveness of this tool
for learning science. We agree with the claim, but the effectiveness
will improve only if we gradually introduce a certain amount of
discipline in constructing the maps. The discipline is warranted, we
argue, because science thrives to be an unambiguous and rigorously
structured body of knowledge. Since learning science may be seen as a
process where a novice is expected to be transformed into an expert,
we use the context of learning science for making the
proposal. Further, we identify certain anomalies in the evaluation of
concept maps, and suggest that the evaluation should be based on
semantics of the linking words (relation types) and not on graphical
criteria alone.</p>

## Teaching Learning Sequences

Nagarjuna G., Meena Kharatmal, Rajiv Nair, "Building a Dependency
Network for Teaching-Learning of Conceptual Structures", Proceedings
of the International Workshop CS-LTA 2010, The First Conceptual
Structures – Learning, Teaching and Assessment Workshop, Kuching,
Malaysia 26 July 2010. [Download PDF
file](assets/Building-a-Dependency-Network-for-Teaching-Learning-of-Conceptual-Structures-2010.pdf)

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">
We propose in this paper a simple method to construct a machine
processable semantic network, called a dependency network, that
gathers all the concepts and skills as nodes and the relation type
“depends on”, (and its inverse “required for”), as their edges. As a
conceptual structure can be used to compute a roadmap of any learning-
teaching objective. As a prelude we build and contribute a seed graph
for demonstration and introduce a collaborative portal for
contributing, publishing and dynamically building dependency
networks. A possible generalization of this methodology for knowledge
organization is discussed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"> With the advent of
networked computers sharing of information and artifacts have become
very convenient. From online multi-player games to social networking
sites, instant sharing has become the norm of the day. Educational
tools are trying to harness sharing as a potential tool to engage
students in learning processes. But, does sharing lead to an
improvement in academic performance? The present study investigates
the role of instant sharing in the context of learning in a classroom
setting. Two groups of students, from a suburban school in Mumbai,
India, played an arithmetic game over a period of 7-8 months.  The
experimental group played on a platform that supported instant
sharing, while the platform for the control group was standalone. All
other aspects of both platforms were same.  Analysis of process data
of the two groups reveals that instant sharing increased engagement
with the game. Students from control group lost interest in the game
after some days, while experimental group students remained active on
it till the end of the four-month period.</p>
