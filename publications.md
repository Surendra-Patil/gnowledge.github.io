### A Slate for Every Child
Amit Dhakulkar, Rafikh Shaikh, "A slate for every child: rethinking
education in the age of computers" *Teacher Plus Magazine*, 15. 30-33,
May-June 2017. [Download PDF file](assets/A-slate-for-every-child_ rethinking-education-in-the-age-of-computers.pdf)

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">
Most of the ideas in this article have come from SeymourPapert, the
main proponent of constructionism. Papert passed away in 2016 after
meeting with a near fatal accident a fewyears ago. We use parables and
ideas from Papert and our experience with children, computers and
constructionism to make arguments in this article. A few years ago
after a talk which exemplified the use ofcomputers in novel ways, one
of the authors (Amit Dhakulkar)was asked this question (not verbatim,
but close): “So, considering that the activity that you have
designed requires a computer and expEYES (an indigenous hardware for
collecting data), how can you scale it up to schools which have
millions of children?” The author was expecting this question and the
short answer to that was: “You give a million computers to a
million children!”</p>

## Justice in a Digital Society

Nagarjuna G., "Distributing Justice in a Digital Society", *Breakthrough: A Journal for Science and Society*, Volume 20, Issue 3, Breakthrough Science Society, 2018. [Download PDF file](assets/mediaPolitics-11-10-2018 .pdf) 

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"> This article is on the
politics of media, covering both digital and non-digital media. The
primary purpose of this short article is to bring home the point that
the current political powers, all around the world, are using the
‘new’ digital medium to make ‘old’ governing systems more powerful,
rather than empowering citizens, although most of the governments of
nations themselves claim to sustain and work towards democracy. We
will discuss centralised regulation and decentralised regulation of
media, and relate this to the concepts of copyright and copy left . A
political movement has taken shape to address the issue, which is
called free software movement , and this has inescapable implications
to several aspects of our lives, wherever digitisation of culture
impacts and effects. [Also published as a blog here, where you can

## Measuring the Mustard Seed

Amit Dhakulkar, Nagarjuna G, and Samir Dhurde, "Measuring the
 mustard seed: an exercise in indirect measurement and mathematical
 modelling", *School Science Review*, Number **356**, p. 063-068, 2015. [Download PDF file](assets/37-measuring-the-mustard-seed-after-referee-changes.pdf)


<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">

We designed a simple teaching/learning activity from real life using
commonly available mustard seeds as an introduction to mathematical
modelling, using a cluster of trans- disciplinary skills and concepts.
As a first exercise for middle or high school students in indirect
measurement using physical and mathematical modelling, we present here
a simple task where students are asked to find the average diameter of
mustard seeds. The resulting observations lead to a simple linear
mathematical model which has accessible physical basis from the real
world. This simple task also provides a rich opportunity and a context
to learn several topics in measurement, modelling, graphicacy and
statistics. We present this as a template to be used for developing a
series of activities for learning indirect measurements, physical and
mathematical models.

## The STEM Games

Nagarjuna G., "The STEM Games", *ICTS Newsletter*, Volume 4, Issue 2, pp.7-9, International Centre for Theoretical Sciences, TIFR, 2018. [Download PDF file](assets/newsletter-2018-vol-4-issue-2.pdf) 

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">
We often speak about the sorry state of
STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and
Mathematics) and STEM education in India. We
recognize the problem, but do not appear to have a
strategy to improve the situation. This is not to say
there are no honest attempts at improvement, but
they have, at best, worked in minimal conditions.
In this short note, we present a model-driven picture
with the hope that this may help us understand the
problem and, hopefully, find a road toward good
STEM policy and practice. [Also published as a blog here, where you can discuss and comment.](https://x.metastudio.org/t/the-stem-games/145)

and Assessing Students’Knowledge Structure,” Episteme 2: Second
International Conference on Review of Science, Technology and
Mathematiics education, 2007. [Download PDF file](assets/An-Alternative-Proposal-for-Eliciting-and-Assessing-Students-Knowledge-Structure-2007.pdf)

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">
In this paper, we propose an objective assessment technique for
evaluating students' knowledge structure. The assessment task is to
create propositions based on with constraints i.e.  concepts and
linking words (relation types). The propositions are validated based
on a comparison with an expert's knowledge base. An illustration of
the technique is presented from the domain of senior secondary school
level biology.</p>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">
Using the methodology of Refined Concept Mapping, we re-
represent the domain of cell biology of secondary and higher
secondary levels of textbooks. In this study, we demonstrate
that although the number of concept terms increase
progressively, the predicate terms achieve constancy
depicting a finite set. This indicates that for acquiring
expertise in a domain, a finite set of predicate terms is
sufficient. In this paper, we illustrate the methodology and
discuss the pedagogical implications of the study.</p>

## Primer for Conceptual Structures

G.Nagarjuna and M. Kharatmal, “Proposal for developing a primer for
constructing and analyzing conceptual structures,” in *Proceedings
of the 19th international conference on Conceptual structures for
discovering knowledge*, 2011, pp. 402–405. [Download PDF file](assets/A-Proposal-for-Developing-a-Primer-for-Constructing-and-Analyzing-Conceptual-Structures-2011.pdf)

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">
A rationale and proposal for developing a primer for teaching-learning
of conceptual structures is presented. The skills re- quired and
developed by an engagement of constructing and analyzing conceptual
structures are richer and easier to be dealt with in school
education. The teaching-learning context of CS is fundamental and im-
portant enough to introduce the topics from logic, philosophy,
computer science and linguistics. A proposal is made for the formation
of a special interest group for the primer.</p>

sentation, propositions, logic, philosophy, teaching-learning.

## Mapping to Concept Lattices
Meena Kharatmal, "A Proposal to Extend Concept Mapping to Concept Lattices for Representing Biology"
in Summer School on “Methodology of task design – How to construct exercises for learning”  Technische Universität Dresden, Dresden, Germany , 22 – 27 September 2014. [Download PDF file](assets/A-Proposal-to-Extend-Concept-Mapping-to-Concept-Lattices-for-Representing-Biology-2014.pdf)

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">
Textbook biology knowledge is being represented as triples using
concept maps. These triples can be extended to create concept lattices
by representing objects and attributes in relation. By focusing on the
nature of semantic relations, concept neighbourhood lattices can be
generated for dependencies, associations. By representing the changes
in the attributes of objects in time, concept lattices of dynamic
propositions can be generated. As the knowledge base for the study is
textbook biology, this research on using concept lattices in school,
college biology education can be further developed with focusing on
teaching learning, cognitive assessment.</p>

## Refining Concept Mapping

Meena Kharatmal and G. Nagarjuna, A Prposal to Refine Concept Mapping
for Effective Science Learning, in *Concept Maps: Theory, Methodology,
Technology Proc. of the Second Int. Conference on Concept Mapping*
Edited by A. J. Cañas, J. D. Novak, Eds.  San José, Costa Rica, 2006. [Download PDF
file](assets/A-Proposal-to-Refine-Concept-Mapping-for-Effective-Science-Learning-2006.pdf)

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">
Concept maps are found to be useful in eliciting knowledge, meaningful
learning, evaluation of understanding and in studying the nature of
changes taking place during cognitive development, particularly in the

for learning science. We agree with the claim, but the effectiveness
will improve only if we gradually introduce a certain amount of
discipline in constructing the maps. The discipline is warranted, we
argue, because science thrives to be an unambiguous and rigorously
structured body of knowledge. Since learning science may be seen as a
process where a novice is expected to be transformed into an expert,
we use the context of learning science for making the
proposal. Further, we identify certain anomalies in the evaluation of
concept maps, and suggest that the evaluation should be based on
semantics of the linking words (relation types) and not on graphical
criteria alone.</p>

## Teaching Learning Sequences

Nagarjuna G., Meena Kharatmal, Rajiv Nair, "Building a Dependency
Network for Teaching-Learning of Conceptual Structures", Proceedings
of the International Workshop CS-LTA 2010, The First Conceptual
Structures – Learning, Teaching and Assessment Workshop, Kuching,
Malaysia 26 July 2010. [Download PDF
file](assets/Building-a-Dependency-Network-for-Teaching-Learning-of-Conceptual-Structures-2010.pdf)

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">
We propose in this paper a simple method to construct a machine
processable semantic network, called a dependency network, that
gathers all the concepts and skills as nodes and the relation type
“depends on”, (and its inverse “required for”), as their edges. As a
conceptual structure can be used to compute a roadmap of any learning-
teaching objective. As a prelude we build and contribute a seed graph
for demonstration and introduce a collaborative portal for
contributing, publishing and dynamically building dependency
networks. A possible generalization of this methodology for knowledge
organization is discussed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"> With the advent of
networked computers sharing of information and artifacts have become
very convenient. From online multi-player games to social networking
sites, instant sharing has become the norm of the day. Educational
tools are trying to harness sharing as a potential tool to engage
students in learning processes. But, does sharing lead to an
improvement in academic performance? The present study investigates
the role of instant sharing in the context of learning in a classroom
setting. Two groups of students, from a suburban school in Mumbai,
India, played an arithmetic game over a period of 7-8 months.  The
experimental group played on a platform that supported instant
sharing, while the platform for the control group was standalone. All
other aspects of both platforms were same.  Analysis of process data
of the two groups reveals that instant sharing increased engagement
with the game. Students from control group lost interest in the game
after some days, while experimental group students remained active on
it till the end of the four-month period.</p>

## Roots of rigor

Meena Kharatmal & Nagarjuna G., "Exploring Roots of Rigor: A Proposal of a Methodology for Analyzing the
Conceptual Change from a Novice to an Expert", in *Concept Mapping: Connecting Educators
Proc. of the Third Int. Conference on Concept Mapping*  A. J. Cañas, P. Reiska, M. Åhlberg & J. D. Novak, Eds.
Tallinn, Estonia & Helsinki, Finland 2008 [Download PDF file](assets/Exploring-Roots-of-Rigor-A-Proposal-of-a-Methodology-for-Analyzing-the-Conceptual-Change-from-Novice-to-an-Expert-2008.pdf)

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"> During the course of
science education one of the recognizable and desirable changes from a
novice to an expert is in their language (knowledge
representation). One noticeable change is that of weeding out
ambiguous expressions bringing in clarity and rigor. However, this
happens not by weeding out the concept names but by choosing more and
more accurate linking words (relation names). By focusing on the
relation names we report the results of a preliminary study that
confirms that subject experts increasingly chose relation names
(linking words) that come closer to formal descriptions. The
significance of this observation to concept mapping community as well
as to cognitive development is immense, for it provides a simple and
effective method to study conceptual change, validates the use of
refined concept maps in place of the traditional technique in science
education, and also further strengthens the approach that relationship
between nodes determine the semantics, and not the nodes per se.

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"> GNOWSYS (Gnowledge
Networking and Organizing System), a generic system for semantic
computing, is a free-software developed at Homi Bhabha Centre for
Science Education (Tata Institute of Fun- damental Research), and is
released as an official GNU project. It is specially made for
publishing vocabularies, propositions, ontologies, complex systems,
web services, semantic computing and such infor- mative resources
including library resources on the web. It is designed keeping in mind
the recent developments in semantic computing and knowledge
representation. It is a hybrid database system with distributed,
hierarchical, object-oriented, relational database support. It can
serve as an information grid, it can export data in regular seman- tic
web standards such as OWL, XTM, and its native GNOWML. It can be used
for creating digital encyclopedia, thesauri, dictionaries, glossaries,
multi-lingual databases, for building e-learning applications, etc. A
unique feature of GNOWSYS is its potential to publish knowledge at the
ultimate granular level (terms and predicates of propositions). In
this paper, we shall demonstrate a case study of using GNOWSYS for
library management and for knowledge management.
