## Eliciting Students' Knowledge
In this paper, we propose an objective assessment technique for evaluating students' knowledge
structure. The assessment task is to create propositions based on providing with constraints i.e.
concepts and linking words (relation types). The propositions are validated based on a comparison
with an expert's knowledge base. An illustration of the technique is presented from the domain of
senior secondary school level biology.
