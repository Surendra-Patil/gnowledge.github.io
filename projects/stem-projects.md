DIY gaming station is an array of neopixel LEDs which provides a
canvas to design your own game. Its made using arduino and neopixel
LEDs which are can be individually controlled. Currently, we have two
games running on it - tetris and snake. There is standalone remote as
well as an app to play the game.The gaming station can enable one to
pick up electronics, programming, and fundamentals of physics in an
engaging and meaningful manner.

## MicroWeather Station

Micro Weather Station is a cost-effective DIY FOSS weather station
developed using the Arduino Mega to provide the weather parameters
such as wind speed, wind direction, rainfall, atmospheric pressure,
temperature, humidity, and light intensity. All these readings are
visualized in real time.  The data collected might be useful for the
further analysis, detecting patterns, plotting graphs, prediction etc.

## AeroPonics
Aeroponics is the process of growing plants in an air or mist environment without the use of soil or an aggregate medium. Here, we have used a PVC pipe to make slots where the plants can be kept. The water is raised up using the motor and then drips through the plants' roots. There is an inbuilt timer which makes the motor switch on and off in a cyclic period of a minute.

## DIY Microscope
In this project, the participants are required to hack the web-camera and invert the front lens to repurpose it a functional digital microscope.
One would be collecting the different water samples and observing it under the DIY microscope.

## Time-Lapse using Raspberry Pi
In this project challenge, participants are required to design a time lapse camera using raspberry pi system. In the process, the participants also learn about the affordance of raspberry pi to do various other projects. 

## DIY Centrifuge
Hard Disk based Centrifuge is a relatively low cost FOSS centrifuge made from scrap hard disk (an e-waste) for DIY biolabs where budget is the main concern. A centrifuge is device which uses the centrifugal forces for separating the different materials suspended in the liquid. As this scrap hard disk are cheaply and easily avialble and also its motor meet the high RPM requirements for the centrifuge. This motor is a brushless DC motor thus requires electronic speed control (ESC) along with  Arduino Nano as controller.

## Incubator
Hen egg is the best example of the single-cell organism. We can construct a simple incubator just using a hollow box. What we need is, only the temperature suitable for incubating the eggs which is 37.7 degrees C. In this hollow box, the relative humidity will be maintained with water evaporation. So, starting from the first day to the eighteenth day, we can see under the flash of light the growth of the embryo. Since the growth of the embryo is very fast in the initial phase, it is very interesting to see the eggs under the mobile torch in the source of light. One can even make a video file using a mobile phone and observe the movement of the growing species inside the egg.

## Chotu Bot
Chotu_bot is capable of tracking black line, responds to Light and avoid obstacle, one mode at a time and all it do without microcontroller. The participants will get exposure to the fundamentals of electronics using passive components.
