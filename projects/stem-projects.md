DIY gaming station is an array of neopixel LEDs which provides a
canvas to design your own game. Its made using arduino and neopixel
LEDs which are can be individually controlled. Currently, we have two
games running on it - tetris and snake. There is standalone remote as
well as an app to play the game.The gaming station can enable one to
pick up electronics, programming, and fundamentals of physics in an
engaging and meaningful manner.

Micro Weather Station is a cost-effective DIY FOSS weather station
developed using the Arduino Mega to provide the weather parameters
such as wind speed, wind direction, rainfall, atmospheric pressure,
temperature, humidity, and light intensity. All these readings are
visualized in real time.  The data collected might be useful for the
further analysis, detecting patterns, plotting graphs, prediction etc.
