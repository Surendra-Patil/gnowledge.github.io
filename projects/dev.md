# GNOWSYS and Gstudio

### Introduction to GNOWSYS

GNOWSYS is a specification for a generic distributed network based
memory/knowledge management. Typically computer memory is managed as a
tree, or as nested arrays. Our attempt in this project is to represent
all forms of declarative and procedural knowledge as a network, and then
develop network processing methods to create and publish knowledge as a
network.

### Node orientated computing

Just as the language LISP provides list oriented computing framework, we
try to model the knowledge as *nodes in a network*. The interpretation
(meaning) of a node depends on the links the node has with other nodes,
and the interpretation of the other *neighbouring* nodes in turn depends
on their network and so on. The nodes are organized and processed
according to a complex data structure called the *neighborhood*, akin to
a frame.
