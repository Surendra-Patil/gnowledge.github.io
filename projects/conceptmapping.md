**Developing a Method for Characterizing Change in Structure of Knowledge by Re-Representation of Concept Maps** 


The project has two primary objectives.

(I) Development of RCM  Method – developing a method based on existing concept mapping by re-representation viz.,  Re-represented concept mapping (RCM), focusing on the meaning and kinds of linking words in a proposition or concept map.

(II) Qualitative Content Analysis – using the developed method i.e. RCM, to find out if it can bear any significance in representation of scientific knowledge; to show emerging patterns/themes specific to domain of knowledge and its representation. 

The broad research questions of the project are:

1. What insights can characterization of linking words provide for the nature of domain?
2. What patterns emerge due to characterization of linking words?
      
An extensive content analysis of cell biology textbooks at 5 different grade levels ranging from high school, to college, to pre-university was conducted. Each sentences were mapped using concept map and re-represented concept maps. This processs has resulted into the following:

- concepts increase exponentially across increasing grades
- linking words as an indicator of expertise through proximity
- linking words attain saturation across increasing grades than concepts
- attributes increase across increasing grades at a significantly lesser rate than concepts
- patterns emerged during re-representation: nominalization, category shift, coalescence,  refined, disambiguation, differentiation of linking words during re-representation 

The results emerged into significant patterns  organized in 3 major themes:

- Theme 1 is related to categorization and category change, emerging into four patterns viz., five kinds of categories of semantic relations; three kinds of categories of attribution; parsimony in linking words; category changes during re-representation
      
- Theme 2 is related to nominalization, emerging into four patterns viz., increase in process-oriented linking words, nominalization of process based linking words, saturation of function category,  prominence of spatial inclusion linking words
      
- Theme 3 is related to proximity with expertise emerging into two patterns, viz., highest match of re-represented linking words and attribution with bio-ontology database, proximity of re-represented linking words with that of experts
